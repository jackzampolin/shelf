Then we came to a big drop, and the jar made the bones slip past one another so as to throw the hand out of position. It did not hurt me at all, and as the horse was as easy to sit as a rocking-chair, I got in at the death.",

      "text": "I think August Belmont was master of the hunt when the above incident occurred. I know he was master on another occasion on which I met with a mild adventure, On one of the hunts when I was out a man was thrown, dragged by one stirrup, and killed. In consequence I bought a pair of safety stirrups, which I used the next time I went out. Within five minutes after the run began I found that the stirrups were so very \u2018\u2018safe\u2019\u2019 that they would not stay in at all. First one went off at one jump, and then the other at another jump\u2014with a fall for me on each occasion. I hated to give up the fun so early, and accord- ingly finished the run without any stirrups. My horse never went as fast as on that run. Doubtless a first-class horse- man can ride as well without stirrups as with them. But I was not a first-class horseman. When anything unex- pected happened, I was apt to clasp the solemn buggy horse firmly with my spurred heels, and the result was that he laid himself out to do his best in the way of galloping. He speedily found that, thanks to the snaffle bit, I could not pull him in, so when we came to a down grade he would usually put on steam. Then if there was a fence at the bottom and he checked at all, I was apt to shoot forward, and in such event we went over the fence in a way that reminded me of Leech\u2019s picture, in Punch, of Mr. Tom Noddy and his mare jumping a fence in the following order: Mr. Tom Noddy, I; his mare, IJ. However, I got in at the death this time also.",

There I made life friends of two men, Will Dow and Bill Sewall; I canoed with them, and tramped through the woods with them, visiting the winter logging camps on snow-shoes.",
