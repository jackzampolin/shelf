The operators, however, absolutely refused to acquiesce in the appointment of any representa- tive of labor, and also announced that they would refuse ta accept a sixth man on the Commission; although they spoke much less decidedly on this point. The labor men left every- thing in my hands.",

      "text": "The final conferences with the representatives of the operators took place in my rooms on the evening of October 15. Hour after hour went by while I endeavored to make the operators through their representatives see that the country would not tolerate their insisting upon such condi- tions; but in vain. The two representatives of the operators were Robert Bacon and George W. Perkins. They were en- tirely reasonable. But the operators themselves were en- tirely unreasonable. They had worked themselves into a frame of mind where they were prepared to sacrifice every- thing and see civil war in the country rather than back down and acquiesce in the appointment of a representative of labor. It looked as if a deadlock were inevitable.",

I found that they did not mind my appointing any man, whether he was a labor man or not, so long as he was not appointed as a labor man, or as a representative of labor ; they did not object to my exercising any latitude I chose in the appointments so long as they were made under the headings they had given. I shall never forget the mixture of relief and amusement I felt when I thoroughly grasped the fact that while they would hero- ically submit to anarchy rather than have Tweedledum, yet if I would eall it Tweedledee they would accept it with rap- ture; it gave me an illuminating glimpse into one corner of the mighty brains of these \u2018\u2018captains of industry.\u2019\u2019 In order to carry the great and vital point and secure agree- ment by both parties, all that was necessary for me to do was to commit a technical and nominal absurdity with a solemn face. This I gladly did. I announeed at once that I accepted the terms laid down. With this understanding,",
