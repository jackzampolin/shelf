          "text": "FEW AMERICAN PRESIDENTS have left such a polarizing legacy as Harry Truman. Perhaps none have. Historians have ranked him among the greatest and among the worst chief executives. His administration was deeply frowned upon when he left office in January 1953. Less than ten years later, a poll conducted by the prominent historian Arthur Schlesinger ranked Truman ninth among American presidents. As re- cently as 2014, a Washington Post poll ranked him sixth. At the same time, others have labeled him a war criminal, for it was Truman who gave the go-ahead to drop the atomic bombs on Japan \u2014 Little Boy and Fat Man, August 6 and 9, 1945.",

Regardless of Truman\u2019s legacy, the first four months of his administration should rank as the most chal- lenging and action-packed of any four-month period in any American presidency. Through declassified war documents, personal diaries, inter- national communications of the highest diplomacy, and other primary sources, the figures who appear in this book will tell you that themselves. Arguably, no other four-month period has had so much import in shap- ing the world we live in today.",
