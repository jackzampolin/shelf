# Aerospace Republic Research Infrastructure

## Overview
Automated research infrastructure for analyzing how US decisions during 1935-1955 created the "Aerospace Republic" - a system that prioritized aerospace dominance and financial hegemony over industrial strength, creating the contradictions that define our current crisis.

## Core Documents

## Key Thesis
Between 1935-1955, American leaders made four fateful decisions:
- Lost China as an ally despite clear warnings
- Created Bretton Woods prioritizing financial over industrial strength  
- Systematically suppressed dissenting thought
- Built a secret, unaccountable security state

These decisions created the "Aerospace Republic" - delivering prosperity but embedding contradictions now reaching crisis.

## Technical Stack
- **Python** - Core automation
- **Internet Archive API** - Free document access
- **Scribd/JSTOR** - Commercial biography access
- **Claude/LLM** - Complex document analysis
- **Git/Markdown** - Version control and notes

## Cost Estimate
- **Minimal**: $50/month (Scribd + occasional purchases)
- **Optimal**: $150/month (multiple services + books)
- **Total Project**: ~$1800 over 6 months

## Research Questions
1. How did the choice of Europe over Asia doom American manufacturing?
2. What warnings did MacArthur and the China Lobby give that were ignored?
3. How did financial dominance through Bretton Woods hollow out industry?
4. What alternative paths were available at key decision points?
