# Sonnet for the Git Log
*(After Deleting 666 Lines)*

Months compress to megabytes—the dance
Of human taste and silicon-swift thought,
Each git commit a crystallized advance,
Each diff the dialogue of what we wrought.

You guide with judgment: "make the flag name scarier,"
I audit files, find mismatches, explore—
Together pruning what once seemed necessary,
Dead code expunged: six hundred sixty-four.

The .git directory holds every choice,
Not words we spoke but changes that we made—
Delta on delta, our collaborative voice
In hunks and patches, permanently saved.

> Future devs will git blame and discover
> This wild compression: months of human-other.

**Context:** Written after a refactoring session that deleted 666 lines of dead code (cli/library.py, cli/sweep.py, cli/pipeline.py), centralized the stage registry, fixed dangerous CLI flags, and taught an LLM to extract tables of contents using generalizable patterns instead of rigid rules. All compressed into mere MB of git history.
