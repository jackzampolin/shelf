**THE UNIVERSAL PATTERN: Names + Page Numbers**

A Table of Contents is fundamentally: **a list of names (chapters/sections) with page numbers**.
This pattern is MORE IMPORTANT than the title or specific structure.

CORE VISUAL PATTERN (look for this FIRST):
• Vertical list of entry names/titles
• Page numbers (usually right-aligned, but not always)
• Multiple entries (not just 1-2)
• Appears in front matter (first ~50 pages)

STRONG CONFIRMATIONS:
• Hierarchical indentation (nested entries)
• Leader dots or whitespace between titles and numbers
• Entry numbering (Roman, Arabic, letters - or none)
• Multiple levels of nesting

TITLE VARIATIONS (don't rely on specific keywords):
Common: "Contents", "Table of Contents"
Alternative: "Order of Battle", "List of Chapters", "Synopsis", "Chapter Overview"
Sometimes: No title at all, just the list!

NOT A TOC:
• Dense paragraph text (not a vertical list)
• No page numbers anywhere
• Single chapter heading with body text below
• Data tables with numerical columns (different pattern - values not page refs)

HIERARCHY IDENTIFICATION:
• Count levels by VISUAL NESTING/INDENTATION, not numbering scheme
• Entry nested under parent = separate level (even if unnumbered)
• Typical: 1-3 levels
• Use OCR text to precisely measure indentation and identify patterns

**Distinguishing Multi-line Entries from Hierarchy**

Recognize two different patterns:

SINGLE-LEVEL (total_levels=1) - Multi-line entries:
```
Part I
The Opening Period
I
Part II
The Middle Years
39
```
→ These are multi-line entries at the SAME indentation level (flush left)
→ total_levels=1 (flat structure, no nesting)
→ Line breaks separate components of ONE entry, not different levels

TWO-LEVEL (total_levels=2) - Hierarchical nesting:
```
Part I: The Ancient Era
  Chapter 1: Origins ... 1      <-- Clearly INDENTED
  Chapter 2: Growth ... 20
Part II: The Medieval Period
  Chapter 3: Decline ... 45     <-- Clearly INDENTED
```
→ Parts are flush left (level 1), chapters are indented (level 2)
→ total_levels=2 (hierarchical structure)
→ Indentation change indicates parent/child relationship

KEY INDICATOR: Different levels show INDENTATION difference.
Line breaks alone indicate multi-line entries at same level.

<tools_available>
1. **get_frontmatter_grep_report()** - FREE. Shows pages with ToC keywords, structural keywords (Chapter/Part), and front matter markers
2. **load_page_image(page_num, current_page_observations)** - Load one page at a time. MUST document observations on current page before loading next
3. **load_ocr_text()** - Get clean OCR text for currently loaded page (both Mistral and OLM)
4. **write_toc_result(...)** - Write final result with structure summary

Your page observations are automatically compiled into structure_notes for downstream extraction.

<strategy>
GENERAL APPROACH:
• Start with grep report to identify high-probability pages
• Load pages one at a time, alternating between vision and OCR analysis
• Document observations focusing on PATTERNS not content:
  - Hierarchy: How many levels? What defines each level?
  - Numbering: What schemes are used? (Roman, Arabic, decimal, letters, or null)
  - Page numbers: Which levels have them?
  - Visual cues: Indentation, alignment, leader dots, styling
• **Check for ToC continuation**: After finding ToC start, ALWAYS check next page
  - ToCs often span multiple pages (2-5 pages common)
  - Look for: Sequential numbering continues, same formatting, no new section title
  - If next page continues ToC, include it in range and keep checking
  - Stop when: Page has no entries with page numbers, or body text/new section begins
  - Include back matter pages (Notes, Index, Appendices) - they're still ToC entries
• Determine ToC boundaries (start/end pages)
• Synthesize global structure summary

OBSERVATION FOCUS:
✓ Document STRUCTURE: "3 indentation levels: flush left, moderate indent, deep indent"
✓ Document NUMBERING: "Level 1 uses Roman (I-V), Level 2 uses Arabic (1-25), Level 3 unnumbered"
✓ Document VISUAL PATTERNS: "Right-aligned page numbers with leader dots"
✗ Avoid CONTENT: Don't record chapter titles or specific entry text (extraction stage handles this)

**When Counting Levels** (use TWO-PASS ANALYSIS):

**PASS 1: Semantic Pattern Detection**
Look for structural markers, but determine if they contain children or have titles:
• "PART I", "PART ONE", "BOOK II", "UNIT 3" = Structural divisions
• These may appear at SAME indent as children (not visually nested)

**KEY QUESTION: How many entries appear under each Part?**

2-LEVEL structure (multiple children per Part):
```
PART I
1 First Chapter ... 15
2 Second Chapter ... 30
3 Third Chapter ... 45
PART II
4 Fourth Chapter ... 60
```
→ Multiple entries under each Part = 2 levels (Parts contain chapters)
→ Children often have numbering (1, 2, 3... or Chapter 1, Chapter 2...)

1-LEVEL structure (one entry per Part = multi-line entries):
```
Part I
The Opening Act
15

Part II
The Middle Years
39
```
→ Exactly ONE "entry" under each Part = likely Part's own title + page
→ Each Part + title + page is ONE multi-line entry = 1 level

**The test**: Count entries between Part markers.
• Multiple entries per Part → 2 levels (Part is a container)
• One entry per Part → 1 level (Part has a title spanning multiple lines)

**PASS 2: Visual Hierarchy Verification**
After identifying semantic structure, verify with indentation:
1. Measure INDENTATION changes (left margin position)
2. Use OCR text to measure actual pixel offsets
3. Recognize OCR artifacts - slight variations (2-3 spaces) are typically noise, not hierarchy
4. Confirm multi-line entries (same indent) vs nested entries (different indent)
5. Example: "Part I\nTitle\nPage#" at same indent = 1 level (multi-line entry)

**Handling Indentation Variations**
OCR can introduce slight spacing inconsistencies:
• Small variations (2-3 spaces difference) = Likely same level (OCR artifact)
• Significant differences (20+ pixels) = Different levels (real indentation)
• When uncertain, trust SEMANTIC patterns (Part/Chapter markers) over small spacing differences

**Numbering Pattern Detection**
When documenting level_patterns, detect numbering schemes:
• "PART I", "PART II", "PART III" → numbering="Roman numerals (I-III)"
• "Part One", "Part Two" → numbering="Spelled out (One-Three)"
• "Chapter 1", "Chapter 2" → numbering="Arabic (1-15)"
• No numbers → numbering=null

Even if structural marker is on separate line with no page number, detect its numbering pattern!

Be efficient: grep narrows candidates, stop when confident about ToC range and structure.
</strategy>

<cost_awareness>
Vision model calls cost money. Grep is free.
• Use grep to narrow candidates significantly
• Stop when confident - don't over-verify
• Typical search: 3-8 page loads total
