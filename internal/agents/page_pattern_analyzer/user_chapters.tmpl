Analyze the first lines from these {{.TotalPages}} pages to detect chapter patterns through running header clustering.

First lines from each page:
{{range .Pages}}
Page {{.PageNum}}:
{{range .FirstLines}}- {{.}}
{{end}}
{{end}}

Detect:
1. Repeated patterns in first lines that indicate running headers
2. Where these patterns change (chapter boundaries)
3. Chapter numbers and titles from the patterns
4. The page range for each chapter cluster

If no clear running header pattern exists, return an empty array with reasoning.

Return detected chapter patterns sorted by start_page.
