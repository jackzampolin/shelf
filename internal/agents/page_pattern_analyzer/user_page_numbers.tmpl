Analyze the last lines from these {{.TotalPages}} pages to detect the page numbering pattern.

Last lines from each page:
{{range .Pages}}
Page {{.PageNum}}:
{{range .LastLines}}- {{.}}
{{end}}
{{end}}

Detect:
1. Where page numbers appear (top/bottom, left/center/right)
2. The numbering format (numeric, Roman numerals)
3. Which pages have this pattern and which don't
4. Any gaps or irregularities in the sequence

Return the detected pattern with your reasoning.
